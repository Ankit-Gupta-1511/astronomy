# JavaScript examples for Node.js

The source file
[astronomy.js](https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy/blob/master/source/js/astronomy.js)
works as a Node.js module. Download the file into your project directory. 
Then in your own source file, do this:

```javascript
const Astronomy = require('astronomy.js');
```

![Vanilla JS](../vanillajs.png) There are no external dependencies! 
Astronomy Engine is completely self-contained, and it always will be.

(By the way, you can use the same file <code>astronomy.js</code> for
[astronomy calculations inside the browser](../browser/).)
