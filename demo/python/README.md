# Astronomy Engine examples in Python

---

### [Culmination](culminate.py)
Finds when the Sun, Moon, and planets reach their highest position in the sky on a given date,
as seen by an observer at a specified location on the Earth.
Culmination is also the moment a body crosses the *meridian*, the imaginary semicircle
in the sky that passes from due north on the horizon, through the zenith (straight up),
and then toward due south on the horizon.

### [Horizon Intersection](horizon.py)
This is a more advanced example. It shows how to use coordinate
transforms to find where the ecliptic intersects with an observer's
horizon at a given date and time.

### [Lunar Eclipse](lunar_eclipse.py)
Calculates details about the first 10 partial/total lunar eclipses
after the given date and time.

### [Moon Phase Calculator](moonphase.py)
This example shows how to determine the Moon's current phase,
and how to predict when the next few quarter phases will occur.

### [Positions](positions.py)
Calculates equatorial and horizontal coordinates of the Sun, Moon, and planets.

### [Rise/Set](riseset.py)
Shows how to calculate sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset times.

### [Seasons](seasons.py)
Calculates the equinoxes and solstices for a given calendar year.
