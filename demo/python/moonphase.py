#
#    This program calculates the Moon's phase for a given date and time,

#    It also finds the dates and times of the subsequent 10 quarter phase changes.
#
#    To execute, run the command:
#    python3 moonphase.py [date]

import sys
import astronomy

print('moonphase.py: not yet implemented.')
sys.exit(0)
