# Source Generator
This directory contains code and data for generating the various
language implementations of the astronomy calculator.
It is only needed by contributors who want to make enhancements
or fix bugs.  People who just want to use the astronomy calculator
for a given programming langauge can safely ignore this directory
and use the source code that has already been generated for that language.
