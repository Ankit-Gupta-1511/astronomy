Column     Heading     Definition/Description

   1       Catalog     Sequential number of the eclipse in the catalog links to
           Number      the map published in the
                       Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000.

   2      Calendar     Calendar Date at instant of Greatest Eclipse.
            Date       Gregorian Calendar is used for dates after 1582 Oct 15.
                       Julian Calendar is used for dates before 1582 Oct 04.

   3         TD of     Dynamical Time (TD) of Greatest Eclipse, the instant
           Greatest    when the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest
           Eclipse     to Earth's center.

   4         ΔT        Delta T (ΔT) is the arithmetic difference between
                       Dynamical Time and Universal Time. It is a measure of
                       the accumulated clock error due to the variable
                       rotation period of Earth.

   5        Luna       Lunation Number is the number of synodic months since
             Num       New Moon of 2000 Jan 06. The Brown Lunation Number
                       can be determined by adding 953.

   6        Saros      Saros series number of eclipse.
             Num       (Each eclipse in a Saros is separated by an interval
                        of 18 years 11.3 days.)

   7        Ecl.       Eclipse Type where:
            Type         P  = Partial Eclipse.
                         A  = Annular Eclipse.
                         T  = Total Eclipse.
                         H  = Hybrid or Annular/Total Eclipse.

                       Second character in Eclipse Type:
                         "m" = Middle eclipse of Saros series.
                         "n" = Central eclipse with no northern limit.
                         "s" = Central eclipse with no southern limit.
                         "+" = Non-central eclipse with no northern limit.
                         "-" = Non-central eclipse with no southern limit.
                         "2" = Hybrid path begins total and ends annular.
                         "3" = Hybrid path begins annular and ends total.
                         "b" = Saros series begins (first eclipse in series).
                         "e" = Saros series ends (last eclipse in series).

   8        Gamma      Distance of the shadow cone axis from the center
                       of Earth (units of equatorial radii) at the
                       instant of greatest eclipse.

   9        Ecl.       Eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the Sun's
            Mag.       diameter obscured by the Moon. For annular, total and
                       hybrid eclipses, this value is actually the diameter
                       ratio of Moon/Sun.


  10        Lat.       Latitude where greatest eclipse is seen.

  11        Long.      Longitude where greatest eclipse is seen.

  12        Sun        Sun's altitude at greatest eclipse.
            Alt

  13        Sun        Sun's azimuth at greatest eclipse.
            Azm

  14        Path       Width of the path of totality or annularity
           Width       at greatest eclipse (kilometers).

  15      Central      Central Line Duration of total or annular phase
            Dur.       at greatest eclipse.
