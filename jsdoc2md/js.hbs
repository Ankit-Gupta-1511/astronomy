# Astronomy Engine (JavaScript)
This is the complete programming reference for the JavaScript version
of [Astronomy Engine](../../). It supports client side programming
in the browser and backend use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
Other programming languages are supported also. See the [home page](../../) for more info.

---

## Quick Start
To get started quickly, here are some [browser scripting examples](../../demo/browser/)
and some [Node.js examples](../../demo/nodejs/).

## Topic Index

### Position of Sun, Moon, and planets

| [HelioVector](#Astronomy.HelioVector) | Calculates vector with respect to the center of the Sun.   |
| [GeoVector](#Astronomy.GeoVector)     | Calculates vector with respect to the center of the Earth. |
| [SkyPos](#Astronomy.SkyPos)           | Calculates right ascension and declination. |
| [Ecliptic](#Astronomy.Ecliptic)       | Calculates ecliptic latitude, longitude, and Cartesian coordinates. |
| [Horizon](#Astronomy.Horizon)         | Calculates horizontal coordinates (azimuth, altitude) for a given observer on the Earth. |

### Rise, set, and culmination times

| [SearchRiseSet](#Astronomy.SearchRiseSet) | Finds time of rise or set for a body as seen by an observer on the Earth. |
| [SearchHourAngle](#Astronomy.SearchHourAngle) | Finds when body reaches a given hour angle for an observer on the Earth. Hour angle = 0 finds culmination, the highest point in the sky. |

### Moon phases

| [MoonPhase](#Astronomy.MoonPhase) | Determines the Moon's phase expressed as an ecliptic longitude. |
| [SearchMoonQuarter](#Astronomy.SearchMoonQuarter) | Find the first quarter moon phase after a given date and time. |
| [NextMoonQuarter](#Astronomy.NextMoonQuarter) | Find the next quarter moon phase after a previous one that has been found. |

### Lunar perigee and apogee

| [SearchLunarApsis](#Astronomy.SearchLunarApsis) | Finds the next perigee or apogee of the Moon after a specified date. |
| [NextLunarApsis](#Astronomy.NextLunarApsis) | Given an already-found apsis, find the next perigee or apogee of the Moon. |

### Visual magnitude and elongation

| [Illumination](#Astronomy.Illumination) | Calculates visual magnitude and phase angle of bodies as seen from the Earth. |
| [SearchPeakMagnitude](#Astronomy.SearchPeakMagnitude) | Searches for the date and time Venus will next appear brightest as seen from the Earth. |
| [AngleFromSun](#Astronomy.AngleFromSun) | Returns full angle seen from Earth between body and Sun. |
| [Elongation](#Astronomy.Elongation) | Calculates ecliptic longitude angle between a body and the Sun, as seen from the Earth. |
| [SearchMaxElongation](#Astronomy.SearchMaxElongation) | Searches for the next maximum elongation event for Mercury or Venus that occurs after the given date. |

### Oppositions and conjunctions

| [SearchRelativeLongitude](#Astronomy.SearchRelativeLongitude) | Find oppositions and conjunctions of planets. |

### Equinoxes and solstices

| [Seasons](#Astronomy.Seasons) | Finds the equinoxes and solstices for a given calendar year. |
